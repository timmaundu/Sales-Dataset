# Sales-Dataset
The Sales Manager has no sales reporting but he has a brief idea of current sales.
He also has no idea of the monthly cost, profit and top selling products. He wants a 
dashboard on this and says the data is currently stored in an excel sheet.

The dataset used where in excel format and they are in to different files and i had to merge them before using the data in them
Links to the two datasets are:

1.Data File: (transactions.csv) â€“ 153 MB file

2.Value Inc Seasons:

Began the Data Analysis By defining the problem statement and in this case the Sales Manager wanted to further 
analyze the dataset to find patterns and help in generating useful information to help make data driven decisions.

Data Cleaning and transformation was done on the data using Python libraries which are pandas and numpy.
The duplicates, inconsistencies and null values where cleaned and the dataset was clean and ready for analysis.

I used Tableau Public to come up with the dashboard that gives an explanation of the sales dataset.
